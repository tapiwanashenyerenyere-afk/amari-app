## Short Description (80 characters max)
AMARI — Australia's invite-only network for the Black diaspora.

## Full Description

AMARI is an invite-only membership network built for Australia's Black diaspora — professionals, entrepreneurs, creatives, and community builders who are shaping culture and commerce across the continent.

This is not another social app. AMARI is a private, curated space where accomplished individuals connect with intention, access exclusive intelligence, and build relationships that compound over time.

**THE PULSE — Weekly Intelligence**
Stay ahead with The Pulse, your weekly briefing on what matters. Curated insights spanning business, culture, policy, and opportunity — filtered through the lens of Australia's Black professional community. No noise. No algorithmic feeds. Just the signal that moves you forward.

**ALIGNED — Curated Introductions**
The most powerful currency in any network is a warm introduction. Aligned matches you with fellow members based on shared interests, complementary expertise, and mutual goals. Every connection is intentional. Every introduction is meaningful.

**THE CORRIDOR — Business Opportunities**
Access a private marketplace of opportunities shared exclusively within the AMARI community. Whether you are seeking collaborators, talent, investment, or partnerships — The Corridor surfaces what the public market cannot.

**EVENTS — Member Gatherings**
From intimate dinners to keynote evenings, AMARI events bring the community together in person. Attend curated gatherings designed for genuine connection, knowledge exchange, and celebration of collective achievement.

**MEMBERSHIP TIERS**
AMARI operates a tiered membership model that rewards engagement and contribution:

- Member — Your entry into the community. Access The Pulse, browse events, and begin building your network.
- Silver — Unlocked through consistent engagement. Access Aligned introductions and priority event registration.
- Platinum — For active contributors. Full access to The Corridor, exclusive content, and premium networking features.
- Laureate — By recognition only. The highest distinction within AMARI, reserved for those who have made exceptional contributions to the community.

**INVITE-ONLY ACCESS**
AMARI is not open to the public. Every member is invited by an existing member or approved by the community. This ensures quality, trust, and a shared commitment to the values that define us.

**PRIVACY & SECURITY**
Your data belongs to you. AMARI is built on a zero-compromise security architecture:
- End-to-end encrypted authentication
- Row-Level Security on every database query
- No third-party advertising or analytics SDKs
- No tracking, no selling, no data brokering
- Australian Privacy Act compliant

**BUILT FOR THE ALCHEMISTS**
AMARI exists because Australia's Black diaspora deserves a space that reflects its ambition, sophistication, and collective power. We are not building a platform. We are building a legacy.

By invitation only.
